Would you like them 
here or there?

I would not like them
here or there.
I would not like them anywhere. 

I do not like
green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-I-am.

Would you like them in a house?
Would you like them with a mouse?

I do not like them
in a house.
I do not like them
with a mouse.
I do not like them
here or there.
I do not like them
anywhere.
I do not like 
green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, 
Sam-I-am.

Would you eat them
in a box?
Would you eat them
with a fox?

Not in a box. 
Not with a fox.
Not in a house.
Not with a mouse.
I would not eat them
here or there.
I would not eat them anywhere.
I would not eat green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-I-am.
